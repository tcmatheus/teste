To run this example:

Add the following line to your /etc/hosts file:
 
    127.0.0.1 example.com


- Starts the server (Oauth2 client server):

    node server.js


- Go to http://example.com:7070/ and try to log in with one of your FB account(s)


NOTE: dating from 22/12/2010, it seems we can nolonger use 127.0.0.1 as redirect_url (as Facebook then redirects to 127.facebook.com and not 127.0.0.1).
A solution is to set some host in /etc/hosts file.
