Here are three examples of use for the OAuth2 client server connect middleware.

  - simple_oauth2_client: an OAuth2 client server connecting to auth_server
    OAuth2 server.
  - facebook_oauth2_client: an OAuth2 client server connecting to Facebook
    OAuth2 server.
  - double_servers: an OAuth2 client who lets the user choose which OAuth2
    server he wants to use.


Before running the examples, you should run:

    make dependencies

This will retrieve needed dependencies to run the examples (connect and cookie-sessions).
